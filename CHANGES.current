Version 3.0.13 (in progress)
============================

2017-03-10: wsfulton
            Add support for member const function pointers such as:

              int fn(short (Funcs::* parm)(bool)) const;

            Also fix parsing of references/pointers and qualifiers to member
            pointers such as:

              int fn(short (Funcs::* const parm)(bool));
              int fn(short (Funcs::* & parm)(bool));

2017-03-10: wsfulton
            Extend C++11 alternate function syntax parsing to support const and noexcept, such as:

              auto sum1(int x, int y) const -> int { return x + y; }
              auto sum2(int x, int y) noexcept -> int { return x + y; }

2017-02-27: assambar
            [C++11] Extend parser to support throw specifier in combination
            with override and/or final.

            [Ruby] #883 - Add support for C++11 hash tables:
              std::unordered_map
              std::unordered_set
              std::unordered_multimap
              std::unordered_multiset

2017-02-08: jcsharp
            [C#] #887 Improve std::vector<T> wrapper constructors -
            Replace constructor taking ICollection with IEnumerable and also add IEnumerable<T>
            constructor to avoid the boxing and unboxing overhead of the original constructor,
            when the type parameter is a value type.
